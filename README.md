# Pymaceuticals-Analysis

In this study, Pymaceuticals Inc., is working on creating and developing anti-cancer medications testing subjects to compare the effect on the medications that are developed in the company. This study is testing a potential treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) which is a form of skin cancer that is common, and the test subjects for this study are mice. 

Over 249 mice with this skin condition (SCC) were given treatments with a range of drug regiments to identify what it would be the most appropiate or succesful treatment for SCC. In the course of 45 days the development of tumors of these mice was studied. The drug of interest that was being studied for these treatment was Capomulin which has a great potential for this type of disease. The analysis is as follows. 

Capomulin reduced the average squamous cell carcinoma tumor volume in the subjects on the 45-day period. It will be recommended and interesting to continue this study over the 45-day period to see if the tumors can be completedly erradicated. It was determined in the scatter plots (see below scatter plots and line regresions for reference) that the heavier the mouse is the effectiveness of the drug will be less, so that means that weight is also an influential factor on how the drug will react in a persons body. 

Out of the four drug regiments (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin) Capomulin and Ramicane appeared to be equally effective, one way to test and compare which one is more effective will be to test subjects that have equivalent tumor volumes.
